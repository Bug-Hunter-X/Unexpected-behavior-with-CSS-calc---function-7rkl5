The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can produce unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` to set the width of an element inside a container might not work as expected if the container's width is not explicitly defined. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or the element overflowing its container.
