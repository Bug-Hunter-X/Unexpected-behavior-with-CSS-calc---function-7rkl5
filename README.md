This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, resulting in an element not rendering as expected due to improper parent sizing.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to resolve this issue. The problem arises from using `calc()` to set the width of an element based on a percentage minus a fixed value where the container is not explicitly sized causing calculation errors. The solution involves ensuring the parent container has an explicitly defined width, thereby providing a reliable base for the `calc()` function to operate upon.
